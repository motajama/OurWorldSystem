# OurWorldSystem

OurWorldSystem is an open-source, static-first public-interest atlas of countries and map units in the global world-system. It is intended to visualize structural positions such as core, semi-periphery, periphery, uncertainty, conflict exposure, press freedom, political freedom, quality of life, ecological pressure, and forms of extraction or externalization.

The current app uses real static Natural Earth geometry with mock indicator data. Classifications are placeholders and must not be interpreted as empirical findings.

## Principles

- World-system classes are model outputs, not moral judgments.
- Every classification should include uncertainty, notes, source references, and source years.
- Disputed or ambiguous sovereignty cases are displayed neutrally as map units.
- Geometry is not political recognition, and the atlas does not adjudicate sovereignty.
- The atlas should prefer public, open, reproducible data sources.
- The frontend must run without proprietary map APIs, tracking, analytics, external fonts, or closed-source map tiles.

## Tech Stack

- SvelteKit and TypeScript
- Static GitHub Pages build with `@sveltejs/adapter-static`
- D3 and TopoJSON for local geometry rendering
- Natural Earth base geometry generated at build time with Mapshaper
- Static JSON data under `static/data/`

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Build

```sh
npm run geo:build
npm run check
npm run build
```

The production build is emitted to `build/` and is configured for a GitHub Pages repository path of `/OurWorldSystem`.

## Preview

```sh
npm run preview
```

## Data

Mock frontend data lives in:

- `static/data/world-system.latest.json`
- `static/data/sources.json`

Geometry lives in:

- `static/geo/world.topojson`
- `static/geo/disputed.topojson` when the optional Natural Earth disputed/breakaway layer is available

The base geometry is Natural Earth Admin 0 countries at 110m scale. This layer is rendered primarily as de facto control boundaries. Disputed and breakaway areas are handled as a separate subtle overlay when available. This geometry choice does not imply political recognition or a sovereignty position.

Future data pipelines should generate static JSON from public sources such as OECD, UN, UCDP, RSF, V-Dem, Freedom House, World Bank, UNDP, UNEP, and related open datasets.
